P: Tower, Air India 101 going around runway 4R. 
A: Air India 101 Heavy, roger, fly runway heading, climb and maintain 2000.
P: Runway heading, 2000, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101, what is the reason for the missed approach?
P: Unstable approach, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101, thank you, turn right heading 100.
P: right heading 100, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, contact New York Departure on 135.9. We'll talk to you in a few minutes.
P: 135.9, good day, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101 Heavy?
P: Approach... Air India 101 Heavy, going missed approach runway 4R, maintaining 2000, heading 100.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, thank you, radar conract. Turn right heading 180, altimeter 30.11.
P: Right heading 180, altimeter 30.11, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101, ATIS is information November, expect ILS approach runway 4R.
P: November, 4R, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101, the RVR for runway 4R 3500.
P: 3500, thank you, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, turn right heading 200.
P: Right heading 200, Air India 101.
P: And... Radar,  Air India 101, could we have longer vectors? We were facing some instrument problems as well.
A: Yes! Okay, it's pretty busy there... so, yeah, you can plan fly a little bit longer final. Was that the reason for the go-around?
P: Affirm, affirm, because we lost the localizer, we lost... and our minima changed and so there were lot of issues involved so we're trying to solve that out if we can even continue with this approach. 
A: Okay, do you need some time to work everything out or are you ready for your approach?
P: No, we need some time to work this out.
A: Oh, okay. Okay, so just fly a heading 170 for me and... is 2000 OK?
P: 170 heading and yeah, 2000 is OK for us.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, speed is your discretion.
P: Speed is ours, Air India 101, thank you.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, fly heading 090.
P: Heading 090, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, turn left heading 360.
P: Left heading 360, Air India 101.
P: And approach, Air India 101, request weather for Stewart Airport.
A: Okay, you are ready for your approach now?
P: Negative, sir, request present weather for Stewart.
A: I'm sorry, say again?
P: KSFW weather, please, sir.
A: Okay, so you wanna divert to Stewart SWF?
P: We would like to have the weather - present weather.
P: And New York, Air India 101, we have some onboard instruments problem and because of that we are not able to conduct the ILS for 04R as... as you said us, and now we are sitting for alternate for what we can do. Can we have any sector visibility where we can come from the other side and not use an ILS and continue on the VNAV and come and land into New York or EWR is the same and we expect.
A: Okay... hang on... fly heading 270, Air India 101 Heavy.
P: Okay, 270 and we are just wondering if EWR is getting better. Perhaps we can go EWR... if there cloud and ceilings are better.
A: Okay, but right now the weather that I have is showing indefinite ceiling 200 at Kennedy, our RVR is 4500 so that's gotten a little bit better.
P: Yeah, okay. The visibility is fine but the problem we are facing with is... the ceiling because we can't continue with the ILS with the ceiling of 200 because everytime we try to lock onto the localizer you know the instrumentation doesn't allow us to do that.
A: Okay, okay you can't... you cannot do like an autoland or something.
P: No, autoland is not available because both... we have got 2 radio altimeters failures so we are on one radio altimeter, we've got a TCAS failure, we've got all multiple instrument failures.
A: Okay, so let me try to find so you need a something with a better... so what ceiling do you need?
P: We need something... where we... you know we have... we can do like a non-precision approach and... you know anything above like 600 or so...
A: Okay, I got it. Okay, I understand now, just fly heading 220 and let me find some weather... I'll find something.
P: Okay, thanks.
A: And just before I go away, what was your potential alternate?
P: Primary alternate was Newark and... secondary alternate is Stewart... both seem to be... you know the same sort of situation.
A: Gotcha! Okay, I am gonna do some research, I'll get back to you in a second just... just hang on a second.
P: Thank you.
