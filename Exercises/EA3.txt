P: And approach Air India 101, can we go to Newark, we'll try there?
A: Air India 101, so I've just had the Newark person getting out. So, it's... the weather is getting a little bit better and hasn't had a go around for... due to the weather.
P: Yeah... that's fine. The problem is the instrumentation problem that we have here. We are unable to do the ILS. Probably we are gonna try VNAV approach in Newark if the ceiling is better than JFK.
A: Okay, so you wanna do the VNAV approach into Newark, is that correct?
P: That's right. It's the only option that we have because...you know, this ILS is unpredictable because everytime we turn towards the localizer, it's just gone.
A: Okay, so your ILS is out of service on both sides of the airplane, right? 
P: Yeah, that's correct.
A: And then you said also the radio altimeters are out on both sides of the airplane?
P: Uh... that's right. We are on single altimeter now.
A: Okay, so you just have the basic altimeter?
P: Uh... yes.
A: The localizer on a VNAV approach into Newark, is that correct?
P: Uh... affirm. We'd like to try the VNAV approach into Newark.
A: Okay, so what we will do is we'll clear for the ILS 4R at Newark, but you're gonna fly as a VNAV approach.
P: That's correct. And if I have a better ceiling, at least once I go visual, I can continue my approach.
A: Air India 101, okay so you are on vectors now. Heading 270 vectors to Newark. You'll do ILS approach into runway 4R and you're gonna fly it in VNAV mode, correct?
P: That's affirm, sir. Thank you very much. And heading 270, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101 Heavy, other than both ILSs and both radio altimeters, what other things have failed on the airplane?
P: Uh... basically here we've got a single source radio altimeter, we've got TCAS failure, no autoland, windshear system, auto speedbrake and the APU is unservicable as well.
A: Okay, I didn't understand what was the last one. So TCAS failed, no autobrake and... standby one second.
A: Okay, Air India 101, so just when you get a chance, give me the people onboard and the fuel onboard, please.
P: Uh... we have a total of 370 and fuel... is 7200 kgs, Air India 101.
A: 7200 kilograms, you said?
P: Affirm, Air India 101.
A: Air India 101, uhm... okay, so you have one operational navigation radio that you're gonna shoot the ILS for 4R at Newark, correct?
P: Uh... yes it'll be, it'll be a... basically a LNAV/VNAV approach that I want to attempt here.
A: Okay, understood.
A: Air India 101, is there anything else that you need from me?
P: We're good sir, Air India 101. Thank you for this approach... and thank you very much.
A: Nah, you're welcome. I wish there was more I could do for ya...
P: Thanks thanks. 
A: Air India 101 Heavy, contact New York Approach 127.3.
P: 127.3, Air India 101. Good day sir. Thank you very much!
