P: KLM 20A, correction, 60A, is going around.
T: KLM 60A, roger, tell me able for the right turn.
P: Yeah, we're able, KLM 60A.
T: Okay, KLM 60A, then turn right heading 060.
P: Right 060, KLM 60A.
T: KLM 60A, reason of the go around?
P: Yeah, we had a very positive wind shear. And what...pull up warning, too low terrain warning, that kind of stuff. And speedgoingwoeards 200 knots at short final.
T: KLM 60A, yeah, all copied, contact 118.405 for the next line up.
P: 118.405, KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, with me?
P: Yeah, we're with you, KLM 60A, 3000 feet, heading 060.
A: KLM 60A, turn right heading 095.
P: Right 095, KLM 60A, we also have an issue with the flaps so... not too much fuel but we also have to figure a few things out. So stand by, please.
A: Uh okay, in that case heading 060 again.
P: 060 again, KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, discrete frequency for you 126.68.
P: 126.68, KLM 60A. 
P: Arrival, goedendag ("Good day." in Dutch), KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, goedemiddag ("Good day." in Dutch), you have some problems with your flaps?
P: Yeah, KLM 60A, roger, we got a flap overspeed on short final in a high energy wind shear. And then they remain stuck at 25 so... we uh... we need a just a few minutes to figure things out but fuel is running low as well. So uh we... we can't continue this... this heading too much more. 
A: KLM 60A, roger, that is copied. For your information it will be runway 22 as soon as you are ready for for the approach.
P: Roger that, KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, do you want some assistance at the runway?
P: Uh... Negative but considering our problem, runway 22 might be too short. It might uh become an unusual flaps setting during Landing. 
A: Yes, I understand it. Okay, so.... I'll keep you informed. 
P: Thank you.
A: KLM 60A, just for you to prepare, it will be runway 27 then for you.
P: Thank you so much. That'll help, KLM 60A. 
A: Keep me informed when you are ready for the approach. 
P: Yeah, KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, turn right heading 180.
P: Right 180, KLM 60A.
P: KLM 60A, for your information we're gonna be landing with 1.6, that is just a little bit over 30 minutes of fuel. 
A: KLM 60A, roger, that is copied. And are you ready... ready for the approach?
P: Yes, we are ready.
A: KLM 60A, roger, that is copied. Turn right heading 250 to intercept the localizer runway 27. 
P: Heading 250, localizer 27, KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, the speed is all yours... leave 3,000 feet on the glide path, you're cleared for the approach runway 27
P: Cleared approach 27, KLM 60A.
P: And Schiphol, KLM 60A.
A: Go ahead.
P: Yeah, considering the flap setting and our fuel computations are kind of out of whacks so... we'll be Landing close to 30 minutes, uh... so uh declaring an emergency at this... at this point, MAYDAY-MAYDAY-MAYDAY. 
A: KLM 60A, MAYDAY copied.
A: KLM 60A, established?
P: Yeah, we're fully established now, KLM 60A.
A: KLM 60A, roger, that is copied. Due to the MAYDAY uh the Fire Brigade is informed as well. You are number one. Contact the Tower on 119.230, goodbye.
P: 119.23, thanks for your help, KLM 60A.
